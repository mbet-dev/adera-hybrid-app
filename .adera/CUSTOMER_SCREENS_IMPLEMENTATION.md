## Technical Fixes Applied

### React Native Web Compatibility
1. **Removed all whitespace between JSX tags** that were causing "Unexpected text node" errors
2. **Fixed patterns:**
   - `</View>\n\n<LinearGradient` â†’ `</View>\n<LinearGradient`
   - `</Card>\n\n<Text` â†’ `</Card>\n<Text`
   - Removed all blank lines between sibling JSX elements
3. **Fixed in files:**
   - CustomerDashboard.js (4 fixes)
   - CreateParcel.js (4 fixes)
   - TrackParcel.js (2 fixes)
   - ParcelHistory.js (2 fixes)
   - App.js (1 fix)
   - BottomNavigation.js (1 fix)

### Theme Integration
- All screens use `useTheme()` hook for consistent styling
- Dynamic colors based on theme
- Material Design 3 color system
- Dark mode ready (when implemented)

### Responsive Design
- Uses Dimensions API for adaptive layouts
- Proper spacing and padding
- Works on phones, tablets, and web
- ScrollView with keyboard handling

## Mock Data
All screens use realistic mock data for demonstration:
- Ethiopian names (Alex Mengistu, Beza Tesfaye, etc.)
- Ethiopian Birr (ETB) currency
- Addis Ababa locations
- Realistic tracking IDs (ADE20250110-3, etc.)

## Next Steps (TODOs in Code)
1. Connect to Supabase backend for real data
2. Implement actual QR code scanning (placeholder ready)
3. Implement map partner selection with OpenStreetMap
4. Connect payment gateways (Telebirr, Chapa, ArifPay)
5. Add real-time updates via Supabase Realtime
6. Implement in-app chat
7. Add photo upload for parcels
8. Implement wallet top-up functionality

## Testing
- âœ… All screens compile without errors
- âœ… No whitespace/text node issues
- âœ… Navigation works correctly
- âœ… Responsive on web and native
- âœ… Demo mode authentication works
