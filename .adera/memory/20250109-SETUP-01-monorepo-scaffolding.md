  - Initialize git repository with main and dev branches
  - Create memory, changelogs, and docs directories
  - Scaffold Turborepo monorepo structure with pnpm
  - Create two Expo apps: adera-ptp and adera-shop
  - Set up shared packages: ui, auth, payments, maps, utils, localization
- Actions taken:
  - Initialized git repo with proper user config (mbet-dev, mbet.digitalsolutions@gmail.com)

  - Created root package.json with pnpm workspaces
  - Created turbo.json for build pipeline
  - Created .npmrc with hoisting for React Native compatibility
- Files changed (summary):
  - .adera/memory/README.md, .adera/changelogs/README.md, docs/software-docs/README.md
  - package.json, turbo.json, .npmrc
  - apps/adera-ptp/ (Expo app structure)
  - apps/adera-shop/ (Expo app structure)
  - packages/*/ (shared package directories)
- Tests & verification steps:
