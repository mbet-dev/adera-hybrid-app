# Active Context - Adera Hybrid App Development

**Date**: 2025-01-11  
**Status**: Backend Foundation Complete - Ready for Supabase Setup  
**Current Branch**: dev  
**Active Focus**: Database infrastructure and environment configuration

## Current Work Context

### Primary Focus
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Complete database schema with business logic functions
- **Environment Configuration**: Comprehensive .env templates for all integrations
- **QR Security**: HMAC-SHA256 hash generation and verification
- **Supabase Setup**: Ready for project creation and migration

### Recent Progress
- ✅ Created 13 database functions for business logic
- ✅ Implemented HMAC-SHA256 QR code security system
- ✅ Built comprehensive .env.example templates (65+ variables)
- ✅ Enhanced setup documentation with step-by-step guide
- ✅ Dynamic pricing and commission calculations
- ✅ Auto-expire and notification triggers

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Create Supabase Project**: Set up production database instance
2. **Run Migrations**: Execute schema.sql and functions.sql
3. **Configure Environment**: Update .env.local with real credentials
4. **Create Storage Buckets**: Set up avatars, products, parcels, shops
5. **Test Authentication**: Verify login/signup flows work

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technology Choices Confirmed
- **Expo SDK**: Targeting version 54 (latest stable for production)
- **React Native**: Version 0.81.4 (compatible with Expo 54)
- **Design System**: Material 3 with Ethiopian cultural elements
- **State Management**: TBD (Zustand vs Redux Toolkit)

### Architecture Patterns
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo with pnpm workspaces
- **Shared Packages**: Clean separation between UI, auth, payments, maps, utils
- **Role-Based Access**: Implemented at app level with shared authentication

### UX Decisions
- **Onboarding Flow**: 4-slide introduction with Ethiopian market imagery
- **App Selection**: Clear separation between PTP and Shop experiences
- **Guest Mode**: Allowed for browsing, authentication required for actions

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization (Current)
1. Fix all version inconsistencies
2. Install missing dependencies
3. Verify build system works across all packages
4. Complete basic UI component library

### Phase 2: Core Services Setup
1. Set up Supabase project and database schema
2. Implement authentication package
3. Create role-based routing system
4. Set up localization framework

### Phase 3: Feature Implementation
1. Build PTP parcel creation and tracking
2. Implement Shop marketplace functionality
3. Integrate payment gateways
4. Add notifications system

## Open Questions
- Should we use Zustand or Redux Toolkit for state management?
- What's the preferred approach for offline-first architecture?
- How should we handle image optimization for Ethiopian 3G constraints?
- Should we implement a unified design token system?

## Quality Gates
- All packages must use consistent dependency versions
- Every component must follow Material 3 design principles
- Ethiopian cultural elements must be authentically represented
- Performance budget: 150MB RAM, 3G-optimized
