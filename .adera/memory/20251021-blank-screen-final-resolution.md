# Blank Screen Investigation – Final Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved  
**Severity:** P1 → Closed

## Summary
- Final cause isolated to `packages/ui/src/BottomNavigation.js` not allocating height for scene content on both web and native. Customer dashboard rendered but was clipped under the navigation wrapper.
- Added `flex: 1` wrapper + shared `sceneContainerStyle`, restored native insets, and preserved theming so all customer tabs render their content correctly.

## Key Changes
1. Updated `BottomNavigation` wrapper to stretch (`flex: 1`) and forward safe-area insets.  
2. Applied consistent `sceneContainerStyle` to maintain themed backgrounds and avoid transparent overlays.  
3. Confirmed fix on Expo web and Expo Go native clients – customer dashboard + other tabs visible immediately post-auth.

## Verification Steps
- Login as `customer` on both web (`expo start --web`) and native (Expo Go).  
- Switch across dashboard, send, track, history, profile – all render without blank states.  
- Sign-out and sign-in sequences maintain correct routing.

## Follow-Ups
- Proceed with theme preference provider and parcel history layout polish.  
- Integrate documentation + changelog entries (this session).  
- Prepare upcoming multi-app router refactor.
