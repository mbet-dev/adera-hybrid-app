# .adera/memory/

This directory contains the structured memory-bank markdown files for the Adera Hybrid App project. Each file documents a milestone, issue, or major decision, following the format:

- `YYYYMMDD-ISSUE-<id>-<short>.md`

## Purpose
- Serves as the single source of truth for project context, decisions, and progress.
- Enables traceability and knowledge sharing across the team.

## Usage
- Add a new memory entry for every major change, milestone, or resolved issue.
- Reference memory entries in commit messages and PRs.

See the project rules for the required memory template.
