Keep developing the native and web app implementations go hand in hand, consistent and similar in both platforms. And at occasions where native only implementations are involved such as native map implementations and QR Code scanning functionalities, improvise the web app to implement an alternative (such as Openstreet maps with Leaflets for map implementations) and/or introduce a fallback mechanism (such as using Tracking Code for inputs as a QR code scanning alternative along with a clear notification to the user) in order to maintain a slick app with effective workaround for the efficiency of our app in all platforms as well as a higher UX.
